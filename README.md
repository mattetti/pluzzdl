# Pluzzdl

Pluzzdl is a Python script used to fetch free VOD videos from http://pluzz.francetv.fr/
Note that the video content is only available to users connecting from a
French IP, if you live outside of France, a proxy should be used. See
`proxy_fetch.sh` for an example of how to use a proxy (set to
127.0.0.1:8080 in the proxy example).
